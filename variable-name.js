//  Best practises for naming a variable.

// 1. javaSript not allowed to use their reserved keywords as a variable name.
// var false = 15;
// var delete = "delete";

// 2. name should be in one word. you can't use two or more words as a variable name.
// var nayok name = 'Sharuk Khan';
// console.log(name)

// 3. Can't use any quatation in a variable name. mind it.
// var "teams" = 12;


// 4. You can use camel case word as a two or more words named variable.also can use an underscroll after a word to start writing another word.

// var myOfficeAddress = "Dhaka";(recommended for JavaSript)
// var my_office_address = "Dhaka"

// 5.Another important thing is you should declare a meaningfull variable name. So that people can easily understand your variable name.

// ex: var moa = "Dhaka"; (not recommended)
//      var myOfficeAddress = "Dhaka"; (recommended)
